## Hypothesis testing

### Steps
1. 


## What are the assumpations for the linear regression?

1. Linearity: the mean of the variate (independent variable) is a linear combination of the covariates(dependent variables)
2. No or little multicollinearity: 
3. Constant variance: the variance of the independent variable does is not deepend on the mean (use robust regression or specify the variance as a function of the mean)
